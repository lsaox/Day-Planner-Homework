# Day-Planner-Homework

In this homework I was given starter code and my goal was o create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am&ndash;5pm) by modifying starter code. The finalized app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
